Kisan Bharat - Empowering Growers by Revolutionizing Agricultural Export with Direct Trading

This is the official code repository for Team Ascent.A website designed to support farmer-community as traditional agricultural export processes involve middlemen,
leading to lower profits and delayed payments for growers. Our SaaS platform connects growers directly with buyers, eliminating intermediaries and 
ensuring fair pricing and prompt transactions. By disrupting the supply chain and empowering growers, we create a more transparent and efficient
marketplace for agricultural exports.
